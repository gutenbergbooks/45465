<h3>THE SUNLIT HOURS</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p style="margin-left: 25%;">
<a id="I"></a>I<br />
<br />
<br />
O the splendour of this joy of ours,<br />
Woven of gold of the sun-lit hours!<br />
Here stands the house in soft repose,<br />
The garden and the orchard-close.<br />
Here is the bench beneath the apple trees<br />
Where lazily the blanched spring<br />
Its petals now doth fling.<br />
And here the luminous birds one sees<br />
Soaring, like presages of light,<br />
In the clear heaven of their flight.<br />
And here, as of caresses rained in showers<br />
From the lips of the higher blue,<br />
Two lovely tarns of softest hue,<br />
Bordered naively with involuntary flowers.<br />
O the splendour of our joy, for we<br />
Live doubly, in ourselves, and day's high ecstasy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="II"></a>II<br />
<br />
<br />
What tho' we see it break before us into flowers,<br />
This garden where we pass the clear and silent hours?<br />
In our two hearts are spirit-flow'rs unfurled,<br />
Where blooms the fairest garden in the world.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For as flow'rs we live and breathe</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When in laughter love breaks forth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And our sorrows sigh like trees</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the dark winds from the North;</span><br />
<br />
For we live as limpid lakes at calm<br />
That mirror roses heavy with their balm,<br />
And rich vermilion lilies of the South,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each like a warm red mouth;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For we utter all delight</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That leaps in feasts and in the spring</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When in vows our words take flight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soar exultant on the wing.</span><br />
<br />
Oh! what flowers are in our hearts unfurl'd<br />
Within the fairest garden in the world!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="III"></a>III<br />
<br />
<br />
This carven column whereon monsters cling<br />
And twist among themselves with ravening jaws,<br />
They seem to pant, and grip with mighty claws,<br />
And from each other anguished cries to wring&mdash;<br />
This was my soul before it knew thyself,<br />
<br />
Oh, thou the ever new, the ever old!<br />
Who earnest forth to me from deeps of self<br />
Ardour between thy hands and joy untold.<br />
<br />
I breathe a scent of faint familiar flow'rs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within thy heart that sleep;</span><br />
And thirsty memory drinks deep<br />
Of kindred echoes from past years of ours;<br />
At the same instants in our childhood, tears,<br />
Unknowing, we have wept;<br />
We must have known like gladness and like fears,<br />
Like trysts with grief have kept;<br />
Long since was I bound to thee as thine own<br />
By One who came, inscrutable, unknown,<br />
Upon my life's adventurous battle field.<br />
Oh! had I searched His face, forgetting fear,<br />
I should have known thine eyes this many a year,<br />
That there between his eyelids were reveal'd!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="IV"></a>IV<br />
<br />
<br />
The night, unfolding, banishes the day;<br />
The moon seems, in its long survey,<br />
To brood upon the sleeping silences;<br />
All the air is pure and clear,<br />
Pure and pale afar and near,<br />
And clear the waters in the friendly mead;<br />
What agony is in the slow<br />
And steady drip of water from a reed,<br />
That sounds and then is hushed below!<br />
<br />
But in my hands thy hands I hold;<br />
Thy steadfast eyes enfold<br />
Mine eyes; I see<br />
Thy peace like purest water undefiled<br />
By cloudy fear, undimmed by hovering wraith<br />
Of doubt, and oh, I see<br />
The perfect faith<br />
That rests within us like a sleeping child.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="V"></a>V<br />
<br />
<br />
Remembering thy gracious gift to me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So simple, so profound,</span><br />
My wondering heart is lost in prayer to thee.<br />
How long it seemed before<br />
I, groping, found<br />
And knocked at thy heart's door;<br />
And from how far I came at last to thee<br />
Whose hands were stretched in silent<br />
search for me.<br />
My heart was eaten by corroding rust<br />
That preyed upon my strength,<br />
Defiled my trust;<br />
I was weary, I was old with long mistrust,<br />
I sickened of the roadway's empty length.<br />
When thy feet wandered into my life's way<br />
They brought a joy so exquisite to me<br />
That, trembling and in tears, I can but stay<br />
To worship silently.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="VI"></a>VI<br />
<br />
<br />
At times thou art the spacious light and air<br />
Of all this tranquil morning garden, where<br />
Sinuous paths wind in the blue haze<br />
Like swans upon the deep blue water-ways.<br />
At other times thou art the shivering wind<br />
Exultant, cool,<br />
Who passes, running fingers light and kind<br />
Along the clear brow of the pool.<br />
When with thy two hands thou touchest me,<br />
I feel the brushing of cool leaves<br />
Against my cheek;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When midday cleaves</span><br />
The dimness, all the shadows secretly<br />
Meditate the words that thou didst speak.<br />
So all the hours pass by some sweet grace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of thine, into my heart;</span><br />
And when at last the wan night comes apace<br />
And rapt in sleep and still, apart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy spirit lies,</span><br />
Feel thro' thy closed eyelids how mine eyes<br />
Dwell on thee with a love beyond compare,<br />
More humble and more clinging than a prayer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="VII"></a>VII<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, let it knock upon our door,<br />
That hand that taps with futile touch;<br />
We have our joy, the rest&mdash;what can it offer more?<br />
The rest with futile, listless touch?<br />
Let them pass our door,<br />
The wearied, mirthless joys<br />
With their tinsel and their toys.<br />
Let laughter rise and sound and disappear;<br />
The crowd move on with million voices clear.<br />
<br />
The moment is so fair with light<br />
In this garden all about;<br />
The moment is so rare with new-born light<br />
Deep within us and without!<br />
Ah, 'tis the part of wisdom, dear;<br />
No longer seek we those who go<br />
By the long highway drear,<br />
With heavy feet and singing low.<br />
But stay we here, contented as of old,<br />
Though night itself strike out the sky above,<br />
Loving within us the idea we hold<br />
Of this most wondrous, steadfast thing, our love.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="VIII"></a>VIII<br />
<br />
<br />
I have given all my heart to thee<br />
As simply as a child<br />
Giving a dewy flower, fresh and wild;<br />
I pressed it to my lips and gave it thee&mdash;<br />
I broke the flower's stem with burning hand;<br />
Speak not, for words may hurt; but with thine eyes<br />
Speak to my soul that it may understand.<br />
<br />
The flow'r that is my heart, my sacrifice,<br />
Tells thee quite simply that one must<br />
Confide in virgin love, as children trust<br />
In God who is so good and great and wise.<br />
<br />
Let the bold spirit revel in the hills<br />
In wilful dalliance and vanity,<br />
But let us worship in simplicity<br />
The very truth that holds our hearts and wills;<br />
Nor can love be more fully said<br />
Than when soul speaks to soul at night, and overhead<br />
The innumerable silent stars like eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Burn each on each,</span><br />
A speaking that surpasses speech,<br />
Amid the barkening silence of the skies.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="IX"></a>IX<br />
<br />
<br />
The youthful spring with wondrous might<br />
Bursts out in all its clarity<br />
Upon our wistful words and sight,<br />
And bathes them deep in purity.<br />
The wind and the slender lips of the flowers,<br />
Trembling, scatter abroad in showers<br />
Their syllables of light.<br />
<br />
But the soul of us will not be caught<br />
Within the chains that language wrought;<br />
One simple flight of spirit doth enshrine,<br />
Better than word or fitful thought,<br />
Our joy in its abiding place divine,&mdash;<br />
That heaven of thine wherein thy soul<br />
Kneels gently down to mine,<br />
And that where wistfully my soul<br />
Kneels humbly there to thine.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="X"></a>X<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come out into the garden fair</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where now the brooding eve</span><br />
Has closed the flowers with its tranquil light,<br />
And in thy soul let sink the peaceful night;<br />
For no longer may its gloom achieve<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To trouble our deep prayer.</span><br />
<br />
Above, the crystal stars are shining forth<br />
With light translucent and more pure<br />
Than ever came from out the frozen North;<br />
Beyond them all, the peaceful skies endure.<br />
<br />
The million voices of this mystery<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Murmur around thee,</span><br />
The million laws of nature's realm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are stirring about thee.</span><br />
The silver tides from all the universe o'erwhelm<br />
Thy heart, but thou hast naught of fear or strife,<br />
For thy soul knows&mdash;it is that love may be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The love that is the work of life</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And its mystery in thee.</span><br />
<br />
Take then this peace the skies have sent,<br />
And lay it to thy soul, since fear has gone,<br />
This peace that floats, like some strange dawn,<br />
Across the midnight of the firmament.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XI"></a>XI<br />
<br />
<br />
How swiftly is she caught in ecstasy,<br />
With her clear eyes of leaping flame;<br />
She, so sweet with clarity,<br />
Meek before life's sternest claim.<br />
This eve how sudden fervour rayed<br />
Her eyes! A simple word did entrance yield<br />
To the garden where she stood revealed<br />
Both queen and serving maid!<br />
So meek herself, but for us two on fire;<br />
To her must kneel whoever doth desire<br />
The harvest of that joy that rolls<br />
From out our two surchargèd souls.<br />
We heard exulting love within us seek<br />
The quiet refuge of our hearts once more,<br />
And the living silence speak<br />
Words we dreamed not of before!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XII"></a>XII<br />
<br />
<br />
At that time when in loneliness I stood,<br />
And desolation deep within me froze<br />
My life, you shone from out the multitude&mdash;<br />
A glowing window on a winter eve<br />
Across the windy surface of the snows.<br />
Your piteous heart brought sweet reprieve,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Caressingly, to me in need,</span><br />
Like breath of spring from off some warmèd mead.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And faith did then command</span><br />
That frankness, tenderness and troth<br />
Should dwell with friendly hand in hand<br />
Within the wind-hushed stillness of us both.<br />
Since then, though summer melts the winter cold<br />
Within, and under skies whose leaping fire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Designs with gold</span><br />
All the winding pathways of our thought;<br />
Though flaming love itself is brought<br />
To far-flung blossoms of desire,<br />
That endlessly, to gain in might,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seek endless birth anew;</span><br />
Always I look to that dear light<br />
Whose sweetness first I knew.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XIII"></a>XIII<br />
<br />
<br />
Of what avail the hectic reasoning<br />
Of what we were and what we may attain?<br />
All doubt is dead within this close where spring<br />
Unfolds within us far from life and pain.<br />
I reason not, nor do I seek to know,<br />
For naught can trouble that within whose scope<br />
Are all of sweet impulse and sudden fervour's glow,<br />
And tranquil flight to sanctuaried hope.<br />
Before I knew, I felt thy clarity;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And 'tis my joy above</span><br />
All else to fill my heart with love<br />
Nor question why thy voice so calls to me.<br />
Come, let our hearts be true&mdash;the day insure<br />
To us the tenderness without the strife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And let them say that life</span><br />
Was never made to reach a love so pure.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XIV"></a>XIV<br />
<br />
<br />
Quietly, like stately queens of old<br />
Who, step by languid step, descend the stairs of gold<br />
In fairy tales, thou movest in my dream;<br />
Names I give thee, such as must beseem<br />
All beauty and all radiance; names that soothe,<br />
Resounding silken-smooth,<br />
Sounds that wind and waver, glide and glance,<br />
Weaving my poems, as in subtle dance.<br />
<br />
Ah, but how soon I leave this play<br />
When I behold thy wistful way,<br />
Thine unadorned, profoundly wistful way;<br />
Thy forehead unafraid and calmer than the day,<br />
Thy peaceful child-like hands laid open on thy knees,<br />
Thy breathing bosom and the dreamful ease<br />
That on thy deep and limpid spirit lies.<br />
How useless and how little in the sight<br />
Of this are all things&mdash;all things, save the naked light<br />
That wells up from thy heart and gathers in thine eyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XV"></a>XV<br />
<br />
<br />
To all thy smiles and tears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My sweetest thoughts I give,</span><br />
Those from a brimming heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And those that live</span><br />
Too deep for language to impart.<br />
<br />
To all thy smiles and tears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And to thy soul, my soul,</span><br />
With all its smiles and tears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And its caress.</span><br />
<br />
See thou, how dawn has blanched all the earth,<br />
The shades of gloom seem put to flight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To vanish comfortless;</span><br />
The lonely lakes have caught the morning's light,<br />
The wet flow'rs glisten and are filled with mirth,<br />
And the golden woods have swept away the night.<br />
<br />
Oh, that I might at last<br />
Enter upon the joyous way,<br />
Oh, that I might at last,<br />
With a victor's joy and a victor's pride,<br />
And thou by my side&mdash;<br />
Oh, that I might at last<br />
Enter with thee into love's full day!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XVI"></a>XVI<br />
<br />
<br />
I bathe in thy two eyes my soul entire,<br />
As tho' in purest water it were laid,<br />
And in their sanctities I quench its fire<br />
That tempered and more keen it may be made.<br />
Oh, to join in utter purity,<br />
As two stain'd windows, smitten by the sun,<br />
Mingle their lights in separate clarity<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And melt to one!</span><br />
<br />
I am sometimes impatient of my lot<br />
As being one who has not and can not<br />
Attain the perfectness he would espouse;<br />
My heart beats on the bars that are its vows&mdash;<br />
My heart whose evil blossoms push their way<br />
Between the rocks of blind brutality<br />
And flaunt shamefacedly<br />
Their swarthy flow'rs in sinister array.<br />
My heart so false&mdash;so true&mdash;as change the years,<br />
My heart of very contradiction made&mdash;<br />
Exaggerating heart where merge and shade<br />
Immensities of joy and startl'd fears.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XVII"></a>XVII<br />
<br />
<br />
That love within our eyes may be<br />
Uttered with all clarity;<br />
Oh, let us cleanse our looks from those<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That chose</span><br />
The way of life's brutality.<br />
<br />
The dawn has flowered in red and gold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Strange softened light</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And mist;</span><br />
It seems as though some tender down of gold<br />
And silver through the twilight kissed,<br />
With dim caresses, all our garden-ways;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our mysterious lake displays</span><br />
Its trembling sheen of golden light;<br />
Beneath the trees swoon birds in emerald flight;<br />
And dawn, from off the gloomy plain, the hillside steep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Doth sweep</span><br />
The last grey ashes of unwilling night.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XVIII"></a>XVIII<br />
<br />
<br />
Mid-summer blooms within our quiet garden-ways;<br />
A golden peacock down the dusky alley strays;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gay flower petals strew</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&mdash;Pearl, emerald and blue&mdash;</span><br />
The curving slopes of fragrant summer grass;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pools are clear as glass</span><br />
Between the white cups of the lily-flowers;<br />
The currants are like jewelled fairy-bowers;<br />
A dazzling insect worries the heart of a rose,<br />
Where a delicate fern a filmy shadow throws,<br />
And airy as bubbles the thousands of bees<br />
Over the young grape-clusters swarm as they please.<br />
<br />
The air is pearly, iridescent, pure;<br />
These profound and radiant noons mature,<br />
Unfolding even as odorous roses of clear light;<br />
Familiar roads to distances invite<br />
Like slow and graceful gestures, one by one<br />
Bound for the pearly-hued horizon and the sun.<br />
<br />
Surely the summer clothes, with all her arts,<br />
No other garden with such grace and power;<br />
And 'tis the poignant joy close-folded in our hearts<br />
That cries its life aloud from every flaming flower.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XIX"></a>XIX<br />
<br />
<br />
May thy dear eyes, thy clear eyes, be<br />
To me on earth<br />
The pledges of felicity.<br />
And may our kindled souls, in showers,<br />
Clothe with gold each flaming thought of ours.<br />
That my two hands against thy heart ne'er cease<br />
To be to thee on earth<br />
The emblem of all peace.<br />
And may we live as two lost prayers implore,<br />
One to the other yearning evermore.<br />
<br />
May our kisses be, on lips in strife,<br />
To us on earth<br />
The symbols of our life.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XX"></a>XX<br />
<br />
<br />
Tell me, oh my tranquil friend,<br />
How absence of a day untuned<br />
And brought our song of love to end,<br />
And wakened every sleeping wound.<br />
I go to meet all those that come<br />
From out that land of mystery<br />
Where thou did'st go toward the red sun-rise;<br />
Beneath a tree I sit, and cold and dumb,<br />
Down the long road spy eagerly;<br />
And long I look with fervour on the eyes<br />
Still lustrous with the sight of thee;<br />
I'd kiss those fingers, for thy touch less wearisome;<br />
I'd utter words whose meaning none perceive;<br />
But, dumb, I listen, hear their footfalls reach<br />
The shadows where the aged eve<br />
Holds the black night in leash.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXI"></a>XXI<br />
<br />
<br />
In those hours when we seem shut out<br />
From all that is not part of us,<br />
What cleansing flood is it, so nebulous,<br />
That bathes and circles our two hearts about?<br />
Joining our hands, without a prayer,<br />
Arm to arm, without a cry,<br />
Seeking we know not what nor where,<br />
Something far off, more pure than thou or I&mdash;<br />
Thou fervent soul, oh say<br />
How does one live in this yearned-for day?<br />
<br />
In those high hours how deep doth grow our will<br />
In front of life's supremacies!<br />
What need of other heavens still,<br />
Wherein with newer gods to cope!<br />
What anguish and what ecstasies,<br />
And what unflinching hope<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To be, one day,</span><br />
Through death itself, the prey<br />
Of these far silent agonies!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXII"></a>XXII<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, this happiness,<br />
Sometimes so rare, so frail,<br />
It brings us near distress!<br />
In vain we strive, as our hearts fail,<br />
To make for us a screening tent<br />
With all thy wondrous hair<br />
To shelter us from care&mdash;<br />
Yet deep within does anguish still ferment.<br />
<br />
But love, a kneeling angel prays,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Asking alone for this,</span><br />
That Fate may give to others equal days<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of tenderness and bliss.</span><br />
<br />
And on those stormy days when evenings share<br />
With highest heaven all their cruel despair,<br />
We seek forgiveness as the night unrolls&mdash;<br />
Forgiveness for the sweetness in our souls.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXIII"></a>XXIII<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, let us live out love with all our powers,<br />
Aspire audaciously in thoughts most high,<br />
That they may interweave in harmony<br />
In the supremest ecstasy of ours.<br />
Because within our twined souls<br />
Something more pure than aught in us,<br />
More sacred, mightier, unrolls&mdash;<br />
Join we our hands, and let us seek it thus.<br />
<br />
What matters it that naught but tears,<br />
Our halting speech avail<br />
For that whose puissant beauty, as it nears,<br />
Doth make our two hearts quail?<br />
Oh, may we thus forever meet<br />
<br />
Love's stern, ensweetened pains,<br />
Kneeling, by fervour overcome,<br />
Before the sudden god within that reigns,<br />
So violent and so burning sweet,<br />
Our very souls succumb.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXIV"></a>XXIV<br />
<br />
<br />
No sooner lip to lip, than we are fraught<br />
With sun-lit fervour that o'erpowers,<br />
As though two gods within us sought<br />
A god-like union in these souls of ours;<br />
Ah, how we feel divinity is near&mdash;<br />
Our hearts so freshened by their primal might<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of light,</span><br />
That in their clarity the universe shines clear.<br />
Ah, joy alone, the ferment of the earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Doth bring to life and stir</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To far, illimitable birth;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As there above, across the bars</span><br />
Of heaven, where voyage veils of gossamer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are born the myriad-flowering stars.</span><br />
<br />
How for us is design of life profound!<br />
All seems as pure as leaping fire&mdash;<br />
Our words so filled with fair desire<br />
We say them o'er to hear them ceaseless sound.<br />
We are the ones, victorious and sublime,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who seek eternity,</span><br />
With humble pride;&mdash;our love shall ever be<br />
Free from the bonds of time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXV"></a>XXV<br />
<br />
<br />
That nothing may elude our close embrace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This depth of holy love,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That through the body love be clear with grace,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I seek with thee the garden of our love.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy breast is there, an offering,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy hands reach out to me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Naive and tender whispering</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is breathed and heard by thee.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The shadows from the branches now</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er thy throat and visage pass,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy hair has spread its blossoms low</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In garlands, on the grass.</span><br />
All blue and silver broods the night,<br />
A silent, sleeping bed, this hour&mdash;<br />
Sweet night! whose breezes one by one deflower<br />
The lilies trembling in the low moon's light.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXVI"></a>XXVI<br />
<br />
<br />
Although, these Autumn eves,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So wistfully,</span><br />
Between the trees, all down the paths<br />
Fall the listless yellow leaves<br />
Between the trees and down the paths,<br />
Although while Autumn grieves,<br />
The night-wind reaps a harvest pale,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So wistfully,</span><br />
Where the late-blown roses fail<br />
Loosing petals wan in showers&mdash;<br />
Ah, let no petal from our love<br />
Fall and wither with the flowers.<br />
But let us both lean close above<br />
The smouldering hearth of memory&mdash;<br />
But let us tend and feed the glowing coals<br />
And reach our hands and warm our souls<br />
Against the winter-cold and misery,<br />
Against the hour that tolls the death of all desire,<br />
Against our very selves, our stricken passion&mdash;<br />
Oh, lean with me above the blessed fire<br />
That Memory's hands have kindled in compassion.<br />
And if the skies be drowned<br />
While passionate Autumn roams the world and rakes<br />
The woods and the wild lakes,<br />
No echo of the madness shall be found<br />
In that safe garden, inmost and supreme,<br />
here in the breathing stillness sound<br />
The quiet footfalls of our Dream.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXVII"></a>XXVII<br />
<br />
<br />
The gift of body, when the soul is given,<br />
Is naught but harmony<br />
Of two tendernesses driven<br />
One to the other, fervidly.<br />
Glory in thyself thou findest sweet.<br />
So fair in thy fresh purity,<br />
Only to offer me<br />
The wondrous gift complete.<br />
I come to thee, and know<br />
Exaltation in this gift of thine;<br />
Always the truer, the more pure I grow<br />
Since thy dear body gave itself to mine.<br />
Love! oh, may it overflow<br />
Our hearts and be the reason in our lives,<br />
Whose maddest happiness is one that strives<br />
Toward the madness of a trust divine.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXVIII"></a>XXVIII<br />
<br />
<br />
Was there ever in us one caress,<br />
One joyous laugh, or tenderness<br />
We dared not strew before us on our way?<br />
Or ever prayer in silence heard,<br />
Whose dim, unuttered word<br />
We sought to stay?<br />
A single yearning of compassion.<br />
A quiet vow or one of passion<br />
We sought to slay?<br />
So, loving thus,<br />
Our hearts, like two apostles, went<br />
Seeking the lowly ones with timid brow,<br />
Who, feeling then so bound to us,<br />
Proclaimed on high love's ravishment,<br />
As a flowery people loves the bough<br />
That holds them bathed in the sun's warm ray;<br />
Our souls, grown greater still by this re-birth,<br />
Began to glory those who feel love's sway,<br />
Increasing love by love's own might,<br />
To cherish thus divinely the whole earth<br />
That seemed reflected in our own souls' light.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXIX"></a>XXIX<br />
<br />
<br />
This fair garden flowering to flame,<br />
That seems the wondrous beauty to proclaim<br />
Of that clear garden whereunto we cleave,<br />
Is crystallised in frosted gold this eve.<br />
A great white silence drops athwart the sky,<br />
Out there where gleams a marble hue,<br />
Whither, one by one, the tall trees stride,<br />
Each with its shadow, long and blue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lonely, by its side.</span><br />
No stir of wind; but soundlessly<br />
The blanched veils of cold alone<br />
Unfold themselves mysteriously<br />
On the marshes' silver or the roads' white stone.<br />
The stars are lustrous with desire;<br />
Like furbished steel the rime<br />
Within the cold, translucid air.<br />
From some infinity sublime,<br />
Across the paleness of a waning moon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Falls shower on shower of fire&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Star-dust that there</span><br />
Sinks in a scintillating swoon.<br />
It is the hour divine, when wistfully<br />
A million eyes look down upon the earth&mdash;<br />
Upon the hazards of our human birth&mdash;<br />
From out immutable eternity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXX"></a>XXX<br />
<br />
<br />
If it ever be<br />
That thou and I should bring<br />
One to the other suffering<br />
Of loss and sorrow; or if fate decree<br />
That weariness of banal joys unstring<br />
The golden bow within us of desire;<br />
If thought's clear crystal vase entire<br />
Must in our spirits fall and break below;<br />
If, spite of all, I lie at last supine,<br />
Vanquish'd for not having been enough<br />
The prey of great, divine,<br />
Utter nobility&mdash;<br />
Oh! let us be like maddened fools that climb the height<br />
Beneath the ruin'd sky; and let us closer, closer cling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in one monstrous flight,</span><br />
With sun-drenched souls, cleave the on-rushing night!<br />
